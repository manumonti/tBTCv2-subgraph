== Install, build and deploy subgraph

=== Testing subgraph locally

This tBTCv2 subgraph can be deployed in a local Graph node for developing and testing purposes.

After deploying https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2[tBTCv2 contracts] in a local blockchain
using Hardhat or Ganache, we can deploy the local Graph node, connect it to this local blockchain
and deploy on it tBTCv2 subgraph.

Deploy local subgraph node on Docker containers

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Deploy the subgraph

```
$ graph codegen && graph build
$ yarn create-local
$ yarn deploy-local
```
